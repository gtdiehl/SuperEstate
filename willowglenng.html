        <h2>What's it like living in Willow Glen?</h2>
        <h3>Willow Glen is bordered on the north by Downtown San Jose, on the east and south by South San Jose, and on the west by West San Jose. When it comes to housing, Willow Glen has no shortage – there’s a great mix of subsidized housing, apartments, and single family homes. Homes in the area are an average of 50 years old, compared to an average of 20-30 years old in other parts of San Jose. However, they’ve been well maintained, remodeled, and updated for modern times. Classic exteriors of Victorian and Spanish styles from the 1920s can often be found mixed in with more modern styling, with beautifully remodeled modern interiors. Home prices also have a wide range and there are plenty of affordable and attractive homes for middle class residents here.</h3>
