# SuperEstate
Bus118W Group Project

A class project that incorporated our HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills to create a website for a fictional local real estate company.

The real estate website is comprised of 7 main features including the homepage.
- Property Listing page
- Built-in Property Search Engine
- Neighborhood Guide
- User login to save Favorite Properties
- Agent biography and contact information
- Seller form

The the website uses a php server and mySQL database for the backend. The php server is used for retrieving data from the database and saving data from the browser.
The majority of the code is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Here are some screenshots from the website!
